Project Description:

This project is a practical exercise in working with animation based on a video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQFZyN-0NxQ). In this tutorial, we delve into creating a website with stunning scroll effects. I will demonstrate how to create such visually appealing sites and thoroughly explain all the aspects and nuances of development using a real-life example.
